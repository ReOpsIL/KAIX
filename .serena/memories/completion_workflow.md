# Task Completion Workflow for KAI-X

## When a Task is Completed

Since KAI-X is currently in the design phase, these are the expected workflows once development begins:

### Development Phase Commands
1. **Code Quality Checks**:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt              # Format code
   cargo clippy           # Run linter
   cargo check            # Check for compilation errors
   ```

2. **Testing**:
   ```bash
   cargo test             # Run all tests
   cargo test --lib       # Run library tests
   cargo test --doc       # Run documentation tests
   ```

3. **Build Verification**:
   ```bash
   cargo build            # Debug build
   cargo build --release  # Release build
   ```

### Git Workflow
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push origin feature-branch
```

### Integration Testing (Future)
Based on the architectural specification, the system will eventually need:
- End-to-end workflow testing
- LLM integration testing
- File system operation testing
- TUI interaction testing

### Quality Gates
Before considering any component complete:
1. All unit tests pass
2. Integration tests pass (when implemented)
3. Code follows Rust best practices (clippy warnings addressed)
4. Documentation is updated for public APIs
5. Error handling is comprehensive
6. Security considerations are addressed

### Performance Verification (Future)
- Context processing performance
- LLM response time optimization
- File system operation efficiency
- Memory usage monitoring

Note: Since this is an early-stage project, many of these workflows will be established as the codebase develops.
